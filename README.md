# Power-BI-Dashboard

Project Overview
This project involves analyzing retail data using Power BI. The objective is to integrate data from multiple sources, establish relationships between the tables, and create a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into sales performance across different dimensions. Additionally, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is used to enhance the dataset by creating calculated fields that support deeper analysis.

Tool Used: Power BI

Business Context
In this exercise, we are working with retail data across four disparate files. The goal is to combine these data sources and derive meaningful insights into various performance metrics, such as total sales units, weekday vs. weekend sales, and other key performance indicators (KPIs) that can guide business decisions.

Situation
You have been provided with retail data from four separate tables. The tasks involve:

Data Modeling: Importing all four tables into Power BI and defining relationships between them to create an integrated data model.
Data Enhancement: Using DAX syntax to add calculated fields that allow for specific views, such as Net Units and performance comparisons between weekdays and weekends.
Dashboard Creation: Building a high-level dashboard with different cuts of data to provide insights into retail performance and trends.
Key Areas of Analysis
Net Units: Total units sold across various periods and segments.
Weekday vs. Weekend Performance: Analyzing sales patterns based on the day of the week to identify trends.
Custom Fields: Calculated fields and KPIs created with DAX to improve the depth of analysis and make the dashboard more dynamic.
Deliverables
Power BI Dashboard: A visual, interactive dashboard displaying high-level insights into retail sales, customer behavior, and other metrics.
